# R interface to the Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine


**Providing access to UC Berkeley's Natural History Data**


This package provides a R wrapper for the newly available [ecoinformatics engine from UC Berkeley](http://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/). The API is very new and currently provides access to two types of data.

* Georeferenced data from the Wieslander project
* Data on > 2 million georeferenced Berkley museum specimens.

## Installing the package

A stable version can be installed from the central CRAN repository

```coffee
install.packages("ecoengine", dependencies = TRUE)
```


Install the package with `devtools` to obtain the latest development version.

```coffee
# If you don't already have the devtools package installed, run
# install.packages("devtools")
# unlike most packages, devtools requires additional non-R dependencies depending on your OS. 
# See â†’ https://github.com/karthik/dlab-advanced-r/blob/master/installation.md#installation
library(devtools)
install_github('ecoengine', 'ropensci')
```

## Documentation

A quick start guide is available both as [markdown](https://github.com/ropensci/ecoengine/blob/master/inst/Using_ecoengine.md) and a [nicely formatted PDF](https://github.com/ropensci/ecoengine/blob/master/inst/Using_ecoengine.pdf?raw=true).
